Introduction

Hate speech and offensive content on social media platforms have increasingly become a critical concern. This project implements a robust deep learning-based system to identify and classify offensive and hate speech in text.  

Leveraging the "Hate Speech and Offensive Language Dataset," a binary classification model was developed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including tokenization, padding, and embedding. The model architecture incorporates Bidirectional LSTMs and a dense neural network, trained with GloVe embeddings for enhanced semantic understanding. By optimizing hyperparameters and testing various decision thresholds, the system achieved an accuracy exceeding 90%.  

This report elaborates on data preprocessing, model architecture, training strategies, and the challenges associated with building reliable hate speech detection models. The proposed system demonstrates significant potential for reducing harmful content on digital platforms, aiding in creating safer online environments. 

 
The exponential growth of user-generated content on digital platforms has brought significant benefits, including the democratization of information, but it has also introduced severe challenges. Among these challenges, hate speech and offensive language have emerged as critical issues with widespread societal impacts. Hate speech, as defined by UNESCO, involves any communication that denigrates individuals or groups based on attributes such as race, religion, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation. Offensive language, though not always targeting specific groups, contributes to an unwelcoming and toxic online environment. 

Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook are particularly vulnerable to the proliferation of harmful content due to the sheer volume and velocity of user interactions. Traditional content moderation techniques, relying heavily on human moderators, are insufficient to manage such vast amounts of data effectively. Consequently, automated solutions using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have garnered considerable attention. 

This project focuses on leveraging advancements in NLP to classify text as either offensive/hate speech or non-offensive content. Unlike traditional keyword-based filtering methods, the system utilizes Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks, which excel in capturing contextual relationships in text. Furthermore, pre-trained embeddings, such as GloVe, provide a semantic-rich representation of words, enhancing the model's ability to generalize across diverse linguistic contexts.
