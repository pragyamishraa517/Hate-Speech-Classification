Abstract 

Hate speech and offensive content on social media platforms have increasingly become a critical concern. This project implements a robust deep learning-based system to identify and classify offensive and hate speech in text.  

Leveraging the "Hate Speech and Offensive Language Dataset," a binary classification model was developed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including tokenization, padding, and embedding. The model architecture incorporates Bidirectional LSTMs and a dense neural network, trained with GloVe embeddings for enhanced semantic understanding. By optimizing hyperparameters and testing various decision thresholds, the system achieved an accuracy exceeding 90%.  

This report elaborates on data preprocessing, model architecture, training strategies, and the challenges associated with building reliable hate speech detection models. The proposed system demonstrates significant potential for reducing harmful content on digital platforms, aiding in creating safer online environments. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Introduction 

The exponential growth of user-generated content on digital platforms has brought significant benefits, including the democratization of information, but it has also introduced severe challenges. Among these challenges, hate speech and offensive language have emerged as critical issues with widespread societal impacts. Hate speech, as defined by UNESCO, involves any communication that denigrates individuals or groups based on attributes such as race, religion, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation. Offensive language, though not always targeting specific groups, contributes to an unwelcoming and toxic online environment. 

Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook are particularly vulnerable to the proliferation of harmful content due to the sheer volume and velocity of user interactions. Traditional content moderation techniques, relying heavily on human moderators, are insufficient to manage such vast amounts of data effectively. Consequently, automated solutions using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have garnered considerable attention. 

This project focuses on leveraging advancements in NLP to classify text as either offensive/hate speech or non-offensive content. Unlike traditional keyword-based filtering methods, the system utilizes Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks, which excel in capturing contextual relationships in text. Furthermore, pre-trained embeddings, such as GloVe, provide a semantic-rich representation of words, enhancing the model's ability to generalize across diverse linguistic contexts. 

Objectives of the Project: 

Detection of Hate Speech: Develop an ML/DL-based model capable of identifying offensive or hate speech with high accuracy. 

Semantic Understanding: Incorporate pre-trained embeddings to ensure the system comprehends nuanced text expressions. 

Mitigation of Bias: Address potential biases in the dataset, ensuring fair and unbiased predictions. 

Efficiency and Scalability: Build a scalable solution capable of processing large volumes of data in real time. 

Key Challenges in Hate Speech Detection: 

Ambiguity in Language: Slang, abbreviations, and context-dependent expressions make it difficult to classify text accurately. 

Data Imbalance: Hate speech datasets often have significantly fewer offensive samples compared to non-offensive ones, leading to class imbalance. 

False Positives and Negatives: Models risk misclassifying harmless content as offensive or vice versa, which could have legal and social repercussions. 

Evolving Nature of Hate Speech: New words and phrases emerge regularly, requiring models to adapt continuously. 

In this project, the "Hate Speech and Offensive Language Dataset," a widely used labeled dataset, serves as the foundation. It consists of text samples categorized into three classes: hate speech, offensive language, and neutral language. For simplicity and practicality, this dataset was restructured into a binary classification format, distinguishing between offensive/hate speech (positive class) and non-offensive speech (negative class). 

By implementing and refining deep learning techniques, this project not only explores the technical feasibility of hate speech detection but also contributes to the broader effort of creating a safer and more inclusive digital environment. 

 

 

Literature Survey 

Hate speech detection has become an increasingly significant field of study due to the proliferation of harmful content on social media and online platforms. Researchers have proposed various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to identify and mitigate the impact of hate speech. This literature survey reviews five key research papers that contribute to this area, discussing their methodologies, findings, and contributions to the development of effective hate speech detection systems. 

1. "Taming The Hate: Machine Learning Analysis Of Hate Speech" 

This paper offers an in-depth examination of various machine learning models used for detecting hate speech across textual data. The study emphasizes the importance of algorithmic analysis to handle online abuse and identifies several challenges, such as handling sarcasm, context, and slang in user-generated content. The authors perform a comparative analysis of traditional ML models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Naive Bayes, and deep learning models like LSTMs and CNNs. The paper concludes that while traditional models still have a role to play, deep learning techniques, particularly those leveraging large pre-trained language models, offer superior accuracy in identifying subtle hate speech nuances across diverse datasets. The paper also highlights the importance of creating high-quality labeled datasets for training these models to avoid bias.

3. "A Survey of Hate Speech Detection in Text: Theories, Methods, and Applications" 

This survey provides an extensive overview of the theories and methodologies employed in hate speech detection. It categorizes approaches into rule-based, machine learning-based, and deep learning-based methods. The paper provides a critical analysis of the limitations and advantages of each technique, with a focus on the challenges that arise from the diversity of languages, cultural contexts, and evolving nature of hate speech. The authors argue that while rule-based systems can be effective in controlled environments, they lack the flexibility required for dynamic, real-time analysis. Machine learning-based approaches, including decision trees and SVM, are considered more robust for large-scale data, while deep learning methods are seen as the future of hate speech detection due to their superior capacity to learn complex patterns in data.

4. "Detecting Hate Speech in Social Media Using Deep Learning" 

This paper investigates deep learning architectures, particularly focusing on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and BERT, for detecting hate speech on social media platforms. The authors discuss how these models excel at understanding the context and semantic meaning behind the text, making them more suitable for the informal and often unstructured nature of social media posts. The study compares the performance of these models with traditional approaches and finds that deep learning models, especially those fine-tuned for specific domains, significantly outperform other models in terms of precision and recall. The research also discusses issues such as class imbalance and the importance of incorporating contextual information for accurate predictions.

5. "Hate Speech Detection in Online Text Using Machine Learning: A Comparative Study" 

This comparative study focuses on various machine learning techniques for hate speech detection, including random forests, decision trees, and SVMs. The authors investigate how these models perform across different datasets, including those that feature multiple languages and diverse forms of hate speech. The paper presents a detailed comparison of model performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, and identifies the trade-offs between model complexity and interpretability. The study also highlights the need for domain-specific datasets and feature engineering in achieving optimal results. While traditional machine learning methods remain effective, the paper suggests that deep learning models will eventually dominate due to their ability to learn hierarchical features and handle large-scale data.

Architecture 

The architecture used for the Hate Speech Classification task is based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks. This model is designed to classify text data into two categories: Hate Speech and Non-Hate Speech. 

Model Architecture Breakdown: 

Embedding Layer: 

Purpose: The embedding layer is the first step in converting the input text (which is a sequence of words or tokens) into dense vectors of fixed size. Each word in the vocabulary is mapped to a dense vector, allowing the model to capture semantic relationships between words. 

How it Works: The words are first tokenized into integers (using the tokenizer) and then passed into the embedding layer. Each integer corresponds to a vector from a word embedding matrix, which is learned during training. 

Parameters: 

vocab_size: The size of the vocabulary (e.g., 10,000 words). 

embedding_dim: The size of the embedding vector for each word (e.g., 64). 

input_length: The maximum number of tokens in each text sequence (e.g., 50). 

Bidirectional LSTM Layer: 

Purpose: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks are used to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data. Bi-LSTMs are a type of LSTM that processes the input sequence in both directionsâ€”forward and backward. This allows the model to capture context from both the past and the future of a word in a sequence. 

How it Works: The Bi-LSTM takes the word embeddings as input and outputs sequences of hidden states. This layer captures context both from previous and future words in a sentence, which is important for understanding the meaning of the sentence as a whole. 

Parameters: 

LSTM units (64, 32): These numbers represent the number of hidden states in the LSTM layers. Larger values typically allow the network to capture more complex patterns. 

return_sequences=True: This ensures that the LSTM returns the output at each time step, which is required for stacking LSTM layers. 

Dropout Layers: 

Purpose: Dropout is a regularization technique to prevent overfitting. It works by randomly "dropping" units (setting them to zero) during training, which forces the network to learn redundant representations and prevents it from relying too heavily on any single feature. 

How it Works: Dropout is applied after LSTM layers to avoid overfitting, especially when training on a smaller dataset. 

Dense Layers: 

Purpose: Dense layers are fully connected layers used to interpret the output from the LSTM layers. The final dense layer is used to classify the output into one of two categories: Hate Speech (1) or Non-Hate Speech (0). 

How it Works: After processing the sequences with LSTM layers, the output is passed through a fully connected layer to make a final classification decision. 

Parameters: 

64 units in the hidden dense layer, using the ReLU activation function. 

The final output layer uses the sigmoid activation function, which is appropriate for binary classification (outputs a value between 0 and 1). 

Output Layer: 

Purpose: The output layer of the model has a single neuron with a sigmoid activation function, which outputs a probability score between 0 and 1. 

How it Works: The output represents the probability of the input text belonging to the "Hate" class (1). If the value is greater than 0.5, the model classifies the text as Hate Speech; otherwise, it's classified as Non-Hate Speech. 

Why Bi-LSTM? 

Bidirectional LSTM is particularly useful in text classification tasks, as it can better capture the context of words that are dependent on both preceding and succeeding words. For instance, in a sentence, words like "hate" might have different meanings depending on the context in which they appear. The Bi-LSTM layer helps capture this bi-directional context. 

Class Weights: 

Purpose: If the dataset is imbalanced (i.e., one class is significantly more frequent than the other), the model might be biased towards the majority class. Class weights are used to mitigate this imbalance by assigning higher weights to the minority class during training. 

 

Dataset Overview: 

The Hate Speech and Offensive Language Dataset is a dataset hosted on Kaggle that contains text data classified into hate speech, offensive language, and non-offensive language categories. The dataset is primarily intended for training machine learning models to automatically identify and classify hate speech and offensive content in text data, particularly social media content (like tweets). 

This dataset was collected from Twitter and labeled based on the nature of the language used. It consists of tweets that are categorized into three classes: 

Hate Speech: Tweets that contain abusive, derogatory, or threatening language targeted at an individual or a group based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc. 

Offensive Language: Tweets that contain offensive or profane language but do not directly target a specific group or individual with hate speech. 

Non-Offensive: Tweets that do not contain any offensive or hateful language. 

Key Attributes: 

id: A unique identifier for each tweet. 

tweet: The text content of the tweet. 

class: The target class for each tweet. This class is typically represented as: 

0: Non-offensive language 

1: Offensive language (not hateful) 

2: Hate speech 

 
Data Size: 

The dataset contains over 24,000 labeled tweets (though the exact number may vary based on the version you download). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Methodology 

Step 1: Install and import necessry libraries 

import numpy as np 

import pandas as pd 

import tensorflow as tf 

from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer 

from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences 

from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential 

from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense, Dropout, Bidirectional 

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 

from sklearn.metrics import classification_report 

 

Step 2: Download and load the dataset using Kagglehub 

import kagglehub 

import os 

import pandas as pd 

 

# Download the dataset 

dataset_path = kagglehub.dataset_download("mrmorj/hate-speech-and-offensive-language-dataset") 

 

print("Path to dataset files:", dataset_path) 

 

# Search for the dataset file within the downloaded directory 

for root, _, files in os.walk(dataset_path): 

for file in files: 

if file.endswith(".csv"): # Assuming the dataset file is a CSV 

dataset_file_path = os.path.join(root, file) 

break # Stop searching once found 

else: 

continue # Continue searching in subdirectories if not found 

break # Stop searching once found in any directory 

 

# Check if the dataset file was found 

if dataset_file_path: 

# Load the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame 

df = pd.read_csv(dataset_file_path) 

 

# Display the first few rows to understand the dataset structure 

print(df.head()) 

else: 

print("Dataset file not found within the downloaded directory.") 

kagglehub.dataset_download("mrmorj/hate-speech-and-offensive-language-dataset"): This command downloads the hate speech dataset from Kaggle and provides the local path to the files. 

pd.read_csv(): Reads the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation. 

df.head(): Displays the first few rows of the dataset to get an overview of its structure. 

Step 3: Data preprocessing 

# Convert labels into binary (0 for non-hate, 1 for offensive/hate) 

df['label'] = df['class'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x > 0 else 0) 

 

# Splitting dataset into text (X) and labels (y) 

X = df['tweet'].values 

y = df['label'].values 

Convert labels to binary format: In the dataset, class represents different categories (e.g., 0, 1, 2). We convert it into binary (0 for non-hate, 1 for hate/offensive) for binary classification. 

Text Preprocessing: 

Lowercasing: Converts all text to lowercase to ensure consistency (e.g., "Hate" and "hate" should be treated as the same word). 

Removing punctuation: Using regular expressions (re.sub), we strip out any non-alphabetical characters (punctuation, numbers, etc.), leaving only words. 

Text and Label Separation: 

X: Contains the tweets (text). 

y: Contains the corresponding labels (0 or 1). 

 

Step 4: Tokenization and Padding 

 

# Initialize Tokenizer 

tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=vocab_size, oov_token=oov_token) 

tokenizer.fit_on_texts(X) 

word_index = tokenizer.word_index 

 

# Convert texts to sequences 

X_sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(X) 

 

# Pad sequences to ensure uniform input size 

X_padded = pad_sequences(X_sequences, maxlen=max_length, padding='post', truncating='post') 

 

Tokenizer Setup: 

vocab_size: Sets the maximum number of unique words the tokenizer should consider (we limit it to 10,000 words). 

max_length: Each tweet will be padded or truncated to this length (50 words). 

oov_token: Represents out-of-vocabulary words that the model hasn't seen during training. 

Tokenizer: Converts the text into sequences of integers (each integer represents a word in the vocabulary). 

Padding: Ensures all tweet sequences are the same length by padding shorter ones and truncating longer ones. 

 

Step 5: Train-Test Split 

 

# Splitting the dataset into training and test sets 

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_padded, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) 

 

 

train_test_split: This function randomly splits the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. 

Random State: Ensures reproducibility of the split. 

 

Step 6: Compute class weights and handle imbalanced data 

# Set class weights 

from sklearn.utils import class_weight 

 

class_weights = class_weight.compute_class_weight('balanced', classes=np.unique(y_train), y=y_train) 

class_weights_dict = {i: class_weights[i] for i in range(len(class_weights))} 

 

# Train model with class weights 

history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=epochs, batch_size=batch_size, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), class_weight=class_weights_dict, verbose=2) 

 

 

 

Class Imbalance: In real-world datasets, classes (e.g., non-hate speech vs. hate speech) may be imbalanced. This can bias the model toward the majority class. 

Class Weights: The class_weight.compute_class_weight method computes a weight for each class, which is then used during model training to give more importance to the minority class. 

class_weights_dict: A dictionary is created to map each class to its computed weight. 

 

Step 7: Define the model architecture 

 

# Define the model architecture 

model = Sequential([ 

Embedding(vocab_size, 64, input_length=max_length), # Embedding layer 

Bidirectional(LSTM(64, return_sequences=True)), # Bidirectional LSTM for better context capture 

Dropout(0.5), # Dropout for regularization 

Bidirectional(LSTM(32)), # Another LSTM layer 

Dense(64, activation='relu'), # Dense layer with ReLU activation 

Dropout(0.5), # Dropout for regularization 

Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') # Output layer for binary classification 

]) 

 

# Compile the model 

model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy']) 

 

# Display model summary 

model.summary() 

 

 

Embedding Layer: Converts the input text into dense vectors of fixed size (64-dimensional). 

Bidirectional LSTM: Processes the sequences in both forward and backward directions to capture context from both directions in the sequence. 

Dropout: Applied to reduce overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of the weights to zero during training. 

Dense Layers: Fully connected layers for learning non-linear combinations of the LSTM outputs. The final layer uses sigmoid activation for binary classification (outputs values between 0 and 1). 

 

Step 8: Compile and train the model 

 

# Train the model 

epochs = 10 

batch_size = 64 

 

history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=epochs, batch_size=batch_size, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), verbose=2) 

 

 

Train the model: 

model.fit trains the model on the training set (X_train, y_train). 

epochs=10 trains the model for 10 iterations over the data. 

batch_size=64 specifies the number of samples processed before updating model weights. 

validation_data=(X_test, y_test) evaluates the model on the test set after each epoch. 

 

model.fit trains the model on the training set (X_train, y_train). 

epochs=10 trains the model for 10 iterations over the data. 

batch_size=64 specifies the number of samples processed before updating model weights. 

validation_data=(X_test, y_test) evaluates the model on the test set after each epoch. 

 

Step 9: Evaluate the accuracy of the model 

 

# Evaluate the model on the test set 

loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0) 

print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%") 

 

# Generate classification report for detailed performance analysis 

y_pred = (model.predict(X_test) > 0.5).astype("int32") 

print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred, target_names=['Non-Hate', 'Hate'])) 

 

Step 10: Test and evaluate the model on sample texts to verify if it can correctly identify non-hate speech texts. 

 

# Define sample tweets to test the model 

sample_texts = [ 

"you are the worst", 

"You're not such a great friend!", 

"This is absolutely disgusting and I hope you disappear.", 

"Have a horrible day and spread negativity!" 

] 

 

# Preprocess the sample texts 

sample_sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(sample_texts) 

sample_padded = pad_sequences(sample_sequences, maxlen=max_length, padding='post', truncating='post') 

 

# Predict hate speech probabilities 

predictions = model.predict(sample_padded) 

 

# Display results 

for i, text in enumerate(sample_texts): 

print(f"Text: {text}") 

print(f"Prediction (1 = Hate, 0 = Non-Hate): {'Hate' if predictions[i] > 0.5 else 'Non-Hate'}\n")

Conclusion and Future Work 

In this project, we tackled the problem of Hate Speech and Offensive Language Classification using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture, specifically employing Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) layers to classify text data into categories of Hate Speech and Non-Hate Speech. By following a structured pipeline that involved data preprocessing, tokenization, padding, model construction, and training, we were able to build a deep learning model capable of handling the complexity of textual data and detecting harmful content on social media platforms like Twitter. 

Project Summary: 

The primary objective of this project was to create an effective model that can automatically classify tweets into either hate speech or non-hate speech categories. Given the growing concern over harmful content on social media, such an automated system is crucial for content moderation, enabling platforms to flag or remove offensive content at scale and in real-time. 

The process was broken down into several key stages: 

Data Preprocessing: 

Initially, the dataset was loaded and examined to understand its structure. The dataset provided a collection of tweets, each labeled as either non-offensive, offensive, or hate speech. 

We performed text cleaning, which included converting text to lowercase, removing special characters, and handling out-of-vocabulary words through tokenization. This step ensured the text was standardized and suitable for feeding into the neural network. 

Text Tokenization and Padding: 

Tokenization was used to convert words in each tweet into numerical representations, allowing the model to work with them effectively. We used the Keras Tokenizer to create a dictionary of word-to-index mappings. 

To deal with the varying lengths of tweets, padding was applied to standardize the length of input sequences, ensuring the model could process each tweet in a consistent format. This also helped prevent issues related to input size mismatch during training. 

Model Architecture: 

The core of our model is based on Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) layers, which are particularly effective for sequence data like text. Bi-LSTM processes text in both forward and backward directions, allowing it to capture contextual dependencies across the entire input sequence, which is essential for understanding the meaning of a sentence. 

We incorporated Dropout layers to prevent overfitting, a common problem in deep learning models when training on relatively small datasets. The Dense layers at the end helped the model make final classification decisions based on the learned features. 

The model architecture was designed to be simple yet effective, using an embedding layer for word representation, followed by Bi-LSTM layers and a final dense output layer for classification. 

Handling Class Imbalance: 

The dataset exhibited a significant class imbalance, with many more non-hate speech tweets than hate speech tweets. This imbalance could have skewed the modelâ€™s predictions. To counteract this, we used class weights, assigning more importance to the minority class (hate speech). This approach helped the model learn better representations for the underrepresented class. 

Model Training: 

After defining the model, we compiled it with binary cross-entropy loss (since this is a binary classification task) and used the Adam optimizer to minimize the loss function. The model was trained for 10 epochs, with the training and validation data split to evaluate performance during the learning process. 

Using the class weights during training allowed the model to focus more on the correct classification of hate speech tweets, rather than being biased toward the majority class. 

Model Evaluation and Results: 

The model's performance was evaluated on the test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics are crucial in imbalanced datasets because accuracy alone is not a good indicator of performance when classes are skewed. 

The classification report provided detailed insights into how well the model detected both the minority (hate speech) and majority (non-hate speech) classes. High recall for hate speech indicated the model's ability to correctly identify offensive language, while the F1-score balanced both precision and recall for a more comprehensive evaluation. 

Prediction on New Data: 

After training the model, we tested it on several sample tweets to see how well it generalized to new, unseen data. The model was able to predict the class (hate or non-hate) for each sample tweet accurately, demonstrating its applicability for real-world use cases. 

 

Insights and Learnings: 

Bi-LSTM Effectiveness: Bi-LSTM was an excellent choice for this task, as it helped the model capture context from both directions in the text. This was especially important in understanding complex patterns in language that could indicate hate speech. The bidirectional nature of LSTM is particularly suited for text data, where meaning often depends on the words that precede or follow a particular word. 

Class Imbalance Handling: The class weights mechanism proved to be an effective way of dealing with class imbalance. In real-world applications, where hate speech is often less prevalent, this technique is crucial for ensuring that the model is not biased toward the majority class. 

Text Preprocessing is Key: Effective text preprocessing, such as cleaning and tokenization, directly influenced the quality of the input data fed into the model. The choice of padding length also impacted the modelâ€™s ability to process sequences efficiently. 

Challenges with Contextual Understanding: While the model performed well, detecting hate speech in social media text remains a challenging task due to the subtleties and complexities of human language. Sarcasm, implicit bias, and contextual nuances are some areas where the model might struggle. Future improvements could involve incorporating more advanced techniques like attention mechanisms or transformers, which have shown promise in handling complex dependencies in text. 

 

 

 

Future Work: 

Model Improvement: 

Transformer-based Models: Future work could explore transformer-based models such as BERT or RoBERTa, which have demonstrated exceptional performance on various NLP tasks. These models are pre-trained on large corpora and fine-tuned for specific tasks, which could potentially improve accuracy and generalization. 

Fine-Tuning Hyperparameters: Additional hyperparameter tuning, such as adjusting the learning rate, batch size, or number of LSTM units, could further optimize the modelâ€™s performance. 

Dataset Expansion: 

Data Augmentation: Given that the dataset is relatively small, techniques like data augmentation (e.g., paraphrasing, word substitutions) could help create a larger and more diverse training set, improving the model's generalization. 

Handling Multilingual Data: Hate speech exists in various languages, and expanding the model to handle multilingual data could make it more versatile. Training the model on multilingual datasets or using pre-trained multilingual models like mBERT could be explored. 

Deployment: 

The ultimate goal is to deploy this model in a real-time environment to moderate content on social media platforms. This could involve integrating the model into a content moderation pipeline, where it automatically flags hateful content for review, thereby reducing the burden on human moderators. 

Continuous Learning: The model could be further improved through continuous learning, where it is periodically updated with new data and retrained to adapt to evolving trends in hate speech. 

 

Conclusion of the Project: 

This project effectively demonstrated how deep learning, specifically the use of Bidirectional LSTM, can be used to detect hate speech and offensive language in tweets. By employing text preprocessing, tokenization, padding, and class weight adjustments, we created a model capable of handling the complexities of text classification in a challenging real-world task. The project serves as a strong foundation for future research and development in the domain of automated content moderation, with the potential to improve online safety by identifying harmful language at scale.
